# BanglaBERT Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a sentiment analysis project using the BanglaBERT model from csebuetnlp/banglabert. The model is trained on the SentNoB dataset, where labels 0, 1, or 2 represent neutral, positive, and negative sentiments, respectively. The goal is to analyze sentiment in Bangla text using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques.

## Objectives

- Utilize the BanglaBERT model for sentiment analysis.
- Train and fine-tune the model on the SentNoB dataset.
- Evaluate sentiment classification performance using accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Dataset

The SentNoB dataset is employed for training and evaluation, with labels '0' for neutral, '1' for positive, and '2' for negative sentiments.<Br>
